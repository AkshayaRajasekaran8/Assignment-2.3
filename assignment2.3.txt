1.Explain in detail:


*Each component of Hadoop 1.x:

  -The components of hadoop are:
                
   1)HDFS: Hadoop Distributed File System takes the data breaks them into pieces 
            and then distributes them to different nodes in a cluster and thus allows the parallel processing.
     
     -The two components of HDFS are:
           -Namenode
           -Datanode

     *Namenode:
               -A namenode stores the metadata.

               -A namenode acts as the master node.    
       
               -It stores the information about the datanodes like  how many blocks of data
                   are stored in the nodes,locations of nodes,which node holds the data,etc.

     *Secondary namenode:
              -Secondary namenodes performs the activity of house-keeping for the name nodes like 
                periodic merging and it is used for edits.

     *Datanode:
              -The data nodes nodes are used to store the actual data.

              -The datanode acts as slave nodes.          

              -It stores the data in terms of blocks.The default size of the block is 64MB.

              -The data node acts as heart beat of the name node as it periodically sends signals to the name node
                   to check whether it is active currently.

    2)Map Reduce: Map reduce is also called as batch processing model or distributed data processing 
                              because it distributes data across several machines.

        -The two components of map reduce are:
                -Job tracker.
                -Task tracker.

        *Job Tracker:
               -The main role of job tracker is to assign the map reduce task to task tracker.

               -Job tracker also maintains the status of the task tracker.

               -It is also used to re-assign some task to other task trackers
                    when the previous task trackers fails or when it gets shut down.              

               -It controls the overall execution of map reduce.

        *Task Tracker:
               -The main role of task tracker is to execute the task assigned to it by the job tracker.

               -It runs individual map-reduce tasks on the data nodes.

               -The task tracker sends the status back to job tracker.
             
               -It periodically communicates with the task tracker.
